# Python GIF creator

## In this project, you can combine multiple images together to help create a GIF.

### Setup:
 - set up a python virtual enviorment (.venv) by creating enviorment in cmd palette.
    - if needed run the command ```source .venv/bin/activate``` to activate the venv.
 - run ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
 - then execute the file ```python gifs.py```
 - an output file (output0.gif, output1.gif, etc...) is the output and can happen with repeating increments the more you do it.

###### Note: 
I've already set up one demo image so feel free to experiment with that if you want or you can go and get your own images. Make sure your images are all the same size else you will get a ```ValueError: all input arrays must have same shape```

Also, I know it's a very simple project but my goal is to stay consistent and make multiple projects throughout my summer break. They will get more complex as time passes.
